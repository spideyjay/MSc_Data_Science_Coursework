### Enhanced University Management System: Technical Report

## Executive Summary
This report details the development of an Enhanced University Management System built using advanced Object-Oriented Programming principles in Python. The system represents a comprehensive solution for managing university operations, including student enrollment, faculty assignments, course management, and academic record tracking. Designed for scalability and security, this implementation demonstrates exceptional software engineering practices suitable for enterprise-level educational institutions.

# 1.	System Architecture and Design Philosophy

1.1 Core Architecture
The system employs a sophisticated inheritance hierarchy centered around a foundational Person abstract base class. This design ensures consistent interfaces while allowing specialized behavior through polymorphism. The architecture follows the Single Responsibility Principle, with each class handling specific aspects of university operations:

•	Person: Abstract base class with validation and common attributes
•	Student: Manages academic records, enrollment, and GPA calculation
•	Faculty: Handles teaching assignments and workload management
•	Department: Coordinates courses, faculty, and students within academic units
•	Course: Manages enrollment, prerequisites, and waitlists

1.2 Advanced OOP Implementation
The system demonstrates exceptional object-oriented design through:
•	Abstract base classes enforcing method implementation
•	Multiple inheritance levels for specialized roles
•	Composition over inheritance where appropriate
•	Interface segregation through focused responsibility methods


# 2.	Key Functionality and Features

2.1 Comprehensive Student Management
The enhanced Student class implements a robust academic tracking system:
Credit-Based GPA Calculation:

python
def calculate_gpa(self) -> float:
    total_quality_points = 0.0
    total_credits = 0
    for course_data in self._grades.values():
        grades = course_data['grades']
        credits = course_data['credits']
        course_avg = sum(grades) / len(grades)
        total_quality_points += course_avg * credits
        total_credits += credits
    return round(total_quality_points / total_credits, 2) if total_credits > 0 else 0.0

This implementation moves beyond simple averaging to provide credit-weighted GPA calculation, reflecting real-world academic standards. The system automatically tracks academic status (Dean's List, Good Standing, Probation, Dismissal) based on both GPA and completed credit thresholds.



2.2 Intelligent Course Enrollment System
The Course class features advanced enrollment management:

Waitlist Functionality:
•	Automatic waitlist management when courses reach capacity
•	Sequential enrollment from waitlist when seats become available
•	Prerequisite validation preventing inappropriate enrollments
•	Capacity limits with real-time availability checking

Prerequisite Enforcement:

python
def _check_prerequisites(self, course) -> List[str]:
    missing = []
    for prereq in course.prerequisites:
        if prereq not in self._grades or not self._is_course_passed(prereq):
            missing.append(prereq)
    return missing


2.3 Enhanced Security and Validation
The SecureStudentRecord class demonstrates enterprise-level data protection:
Sensitive Data Handling:
•	Encrypted storage of Social Security Numbers
•	Audit logging for all sensitive data access
•	Comprehensive input validation using regular expressions
•	Type hints throughout for better code reliability


Validation Framework:

python
def _validate_email(self, email: str) -> str:
    pattern = r'^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$'
    if not isinstance(email, str) or not re.match(pattern, email):
        raise ValueError("Invalid email format")
    return email


2.4 Polymorphic Behaviour System
The system demonstrates advanced polymorphism through method overriding:
Role-Specific Responsibilities:
•	Undergraduate students focus on coursework and club participation
•	Graduate students emphasize research and teaching assistance
•	Professors handle advanced teaching and research supervision
•	Lecturers concentrate on undergraduate education
•	TAs provide teaching support under supervision


# 3.	Usage Guide and Implementation

3.1 System Initialization
To implement the university management system:
Department Setup:

python
# Create department
cs_dept = Department("Computer Science")

# Add faculty with validation
professor = Professor("Dr. Smith", "F001", "smith@cs.edu", "Computer Science")
cs_dept.add_faculty(professor)

# Create courses with credits and prerequisites
cs101 = Course("CS101", "Intro to Programming", credits=4, prerequisites=[])
cs201 = Course("CS201", "Data Structures", credits=4, prerequisites=["CS101"])

3.2 Student Lifecycle Management
 - Enrollment Process:

python
# Student creation with validation
student = UndergraduateStudent("Alice Johnson", "U001", "alice@university.edu")

# Course enrollment with automatic prerequisite checking
student.enroll_course(cs101)  # Success
student.enroll_course(cs201)  # Fails until CS101 completed

- Academic Record Management:

python
# Adding grades with credit awareness
student.add_grade("CS101", 3.8, credits=4)
student.add_grade("MATH101", 3.2, credits=3)

# Automatic GPA and status updates
print(f"GPA: {student.calculate_gpa()}")  # Credit-weighted calculation
print(f"Status: {student.get_academic_status()}")



3.3 Faculty Workload Management
- Assignment and Tracking:

python
# Assign courses to faculty
cs_dept.assign_faculty_to_course(professor, cs101)

# Workload monitoring
workload = professor.calculate_workload()
print(f"Teaching load: {workload['total_credits']} credits")
